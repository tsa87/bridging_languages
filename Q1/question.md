# Question 1 (3 points)

Implement 3 distinct sorting algorithms for arrays of integers faster than O(n^2) average case. Each sorting method must be implemented in a different language. Include the name of the sorting algorithm you are using in your response.

Note: You should not use libraries or built in functions such as .qsort()

Your programs should take as input, on standard input, a file where the first line is the length of the array to be sorted, expressed as an unsigned integer representable in 64-bits, followed by a newline character, and on the second line, a space-separated list of unsigned 64-bit integers to be sorted in decimal notation. Your programs should output to the sorted array to standard output as a space separated list on a single line.
